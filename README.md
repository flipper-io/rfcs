# Flipper RFCs

Flipper RFCs (requests for comments) serve as a means to communicate new ideas
to potentially integrate into the Flipper platform. This can include new
features or design improvements in the scope of Flipper tooling, library
support, and language support. This RFC system is the channel with which to
communicate these ideas with the developers, and are the basis for discussion
and thorough design.
